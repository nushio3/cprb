Cprb is a C Preprocessor in Ruby flavor, written in Haskell.


philosophy of Cprb:

1. C preprocessor is poor. This is the origin of suffering.
2. Then why not use a better language.
3. minimum implementation cost
4. use in emacs c++-mode

Bad news for those who loves Haskell: auto-indent ruins the indent within
comment, so I couldn't use the indent-dependent language. Not to mention
P*****.


rules for Cprb:

Program of Cprb looks like a legal C program. But after some minor editing, it
is first interpreted and run as a Ruby program. The standard output of the run
becomes a C program. A Cprb program has Ruby region and C region. It starts
from a Ruby region, and switches into C region by quoting comments.

"*/

/*"


"*/ is changed into <<UNIQUETAG and /*" to UNIQUETAG. Some special
rules apply between "*/ and /*" :

- (n) repeated occurence of \ is mapped to (2n) repeat
- if some letters are before /*" or after "*/, newline is inserted.
- if only spaces are before /*", they get truncated.

Commented and uncommented letters in C region get quoted. Commented letters in
Ruby region become part of the ruby program. Uncommented letters in Ruby
region are ignored.
